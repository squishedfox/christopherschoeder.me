# Central Processing Unit (CPUs)

- Most common brands, Intel, ARM, and AMD
- Mobile devices typically run on ARM architectures
- 3.2 GHz = 3.2 billion cycles per second

## Architecture Types

- 32-bit
- 64-bit
  - Typically supports both 32-bit and 64-bit application
  - Primary benefit is more memory


## Multithreading

- Simulates a second Processor

### Multicore Processing

- Multiple cores inside the same CPU box


### Parallel Execution

- Threading
  - Fetch Get the data from the EDB
  - Decode Figure out what type of command needs to happen
  - Execute thread calculation
  - Write and send data
 
## Caching

- Modern CPUs have three caches, L1 Cache, L2 Cache, L3, Cache

### L1 Cache

- Smallest
- fastest
- inside CPU

### L2 Cache

- Medium
- Slow
- Outside

### L3 Cache

- Large
- Slowest
- Outside

## Integrated Memory Controller

- Helps to provide guidence on how to use memory

## Integrated Graphics Processuing Unit

- Some Processors have integrated GPUs along side their CPUs

## Security

- NX bit technology enalbed the CPU to protect certain sections of memory
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is turned on  by default in every Operating System (OS)

## Sockets

- Provide a physical interface from the chip to the motherboard set
- Typicallly the sockets are keyed so they cannot be inserted incorrectly the CPU onto the motherboard

## Cooling

- Requires Heatsink to move heat away from the processor
- Fan Cooling provides active cooling
- Water Cooling provides active cooling
- Thermal paste
- Heatsink provides passive cooling
 
## Devices

- require heat to be disperssed much faster than a desktop computer.
- Thermal design power (TDP) measured in Watts is used to measure heat generated.

## Overclocking

- Voids warrenties
- Systems will carrode sooner than manufacture designed
