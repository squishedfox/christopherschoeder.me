## LCD

- Made of Liquid crystals

### Components

- Panel
- Power
- Analog/digital Converter

- LCD Panel

## Resolutions

- How many pixels across and how many pixels down
- PPI: Pixels Per Inch
- LCD monitors are design to run at native resolution that provides the best quality
- LCD has to use an edge-blurring technique call interpolation to soften the jagged corners of the pixels
- This is used when running at lower than native resolution

## Response Rate

- The rate is the amount of time it takes for all the sub-pixels on the panel to change from one state to another

## Refresh Rate

- How many times the screen changes
- 60 Hz is common for most workstations
- Higher resolutions will get to 144 Hz

## Contrast Ratio

- Contrast ratio is the difference between the darkest and the lightest spots that the monitor can display
- Average 450:1, low 250:1 and high 1000:1

## Color Depth

- number of colors that the monitor can show
- Modern Monitors use an 8-bit panel, with 256 (28) colors per channel
- This translates to 24-bit color, meaning the monitor can display 16.7 million color variations

## Connections

- DVI
- HDMI
- Display Port Full, Mini
- Thunderbolt
- HDBaseT
- USB-C
- AGP - Deprecated
