# Printers

- Allow to generate hardcopy documents
- Modern printers can be categorized into several types
  - Impact, ikject, dye-sublimation, thermal, laster, 3-d, and virtual

## All-in-one printer

- Wireless
- Print in color
- Usually Print fast

## Types of prints

- Dot Matrix - not used anymore
- Inkjet - Most common for home
- Laser - most common for office
- All in one- small offices and sometimes homes

## Inkjet cartridges

- There is a black cartridge

## Network Printer

- Directly connected to an internal or external network
- Printer runs a server listening for connections to run print jobs
- Provides cloud access to print directly to a printer

## Dye-Sublimation Printers

- High printers
- Use Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black method of color print
- Cost more money
- Slower than most printers

## Thermal Printers

- Mostly used for black and white printing
- Thermal wax printers require a special kind of paper to print on

## Laser Printers

- Laser printers use elctro-photographic imaging to produce high-quality and high-speed output of text and graphics
They use photoconductive compounds - when exposed to light will conduct electricity
- use toner cartridges
- Toners have several mechanical parts that usually get a lot of wear and tear
- The black toner used in the laser printers is typically carbo mixed into polyester resin
- Color toner trades carbon for the other pigments

## 3-D Printers

- Home use printers use
  - use plastic filament to create 3-D models

## Virtual Printers

- Print to PDF
- Print to XPS
- Print to Image
- Cloud and Remote Printing

## Printer Languages

- ASCII
- PostScript
- HP Printer Command Language (PCL)
- Windows CDI and XPS
- XPS

## Scanners

- Can make digitial copies of existing paper photos, documents, drawings, etc.
- Flatbed scanners are the most common variety of scanner
- Some scanners and multifunction devices have an automatic document feeder (ADF)
- The scanning software that controls the hardware can be built into applications or stand alone
- Default driver are the traditional TWAIN drivers
- GNU Image manipulation Program (GIMP) is open source image editor
- Some scanners offer a feature called optical character recognition
- Scanners convert the scanned image into a grid of pixels (dots)
- Max number of pixesl or resolution dtermines how good an image it can scna
- Optical resolution is native and softwrae based resolution is useless
- The color depth of a scan defines the number of bits of information the scanner can use to describe each individual pixels

## Troubleshooting

#### Configuration

- Paper
  - Type
  - Size
  - Quality
  - Manual/auto feed 
- Layout
- Scaling
- Reverse (inver or mirror)
- Duplex: One side or both sides, collate

#### Tools

- Cleaning supplies
- Extra cartridges
- Mutlimeter
- Basic tool kit, screwdrivers, pliers, forceps, magnets
- USB drive with test print documents and generic drivers/documentation

#### Common Issues

#### Not Printing

- Check obvious issues
- Check spooler and print queue

#### Unexpected size/color

- Check settings

#### Garbled characters/misaligned

- Calibrate the printer/cartridge
- Check drivers

#### Display Screen Issues

- Could be due to wear/tear or freeze up
- Firmware updates

#### Power on

- the initial powering up requires more power than when operational
- Laser printer - turn on the printer first, wait for the warm up before turning on computesr

#### Smudges or partial prints

- Check th eprint head (esp. if it's a inkjet printer) adjust if necessary

#### Injket printer issues

- Inkjet printers are failry stable and good for sustained use these days
- Most come with some manintenance software you can download from manufacture site
- Clean clogged nozzles with water
  Check if the manufacturur approved ink cartridge is being used, calibrated and has ink inside
- Humidity and environmental factors

## 3D Printers

- Stringing issues
- Overheating and melting of products
- Clogged extruders - can be cleaned with rubbing alchohol
- Layer shifting
