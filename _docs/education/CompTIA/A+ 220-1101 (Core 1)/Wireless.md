# Wireless

- Provide physical ports RJ-45
- Allow network connections to be used over radio signal (wirelessly) which extends the usage beyond the available jacks of the router

## Speed and Range

- Each Wireless Node can have different range for wireless connection based on radio signal frequency and send certain amounts of data

## Signal Standards

- IEEE 802.11
- Bandwidth can happen in different channels with 5Ghz and 2.4 Ghz
- 2.4Gh can have 14 channels
- 5 Ghz can have 8 channels

## Inferred

- Half dupliex, can only listen or talk
- Fast, can move 4 Mbps

## Bluetooth

- PAN (personal area network)
- Allow to connect various devices wirelessly to each other
- Power consumption can very based on tye type of device being used, or consuming

## WAN

- Wide Area Network (possibly provided by a city)

## Line-of-sight

- Towers that specifically target areas that are challenging to bring connection to, think mountains and valleys.

## Cellular

- Large network built by Cell Phone Providers

## Tethering

- Convert a device into a hot spot which can be used as a short range wireless router.

## Troubleshooting

- Misconfigured Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Misconfigured Domain Name Server (DNS)
- Possibly DHCP resolver (Router issue)
