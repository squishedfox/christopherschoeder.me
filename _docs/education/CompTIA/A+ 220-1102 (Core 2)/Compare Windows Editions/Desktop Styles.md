# Desktop Styles

## The Windows user interface (UI) is based around the desktop, start menu, taskbar, and notification area elements. Windows 8 was the only Operating System to diverge from the "classic" mode where there is always a taskbar menu and a start menu. The Windows 8 interface had tiles which had to be utialized to get to the operating system settings. Users could toggle between the classic windows view, for the "new" windows view. Windows 10 removed all of the window 8 tile fetaures and returend to the taskbar and start menu.
