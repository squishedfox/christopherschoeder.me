# Windows Upgrade Paths and Feature Updates

## Upgrade Paths

- Validate that all current software and hardware are supported by the new Operating System.
- Validate backups of all files and systems are preserved on an external device or on cloud storage.

## Downgrading

In some cases you cannot downgrate your system, such as with Microsoft Windows Enterprise Edition. When downgrading some applications and settings may become unavailable for simply stop functioning but persist in the Graphical User interface (GUI).

## Feature Updates

Windows feature releases follow the format of YYMM as the version. So for example if the relase year was 2016, and the relase month was July (07) then the release version would be 1607.
