# Home Router Firewall Configuration

Home routers can configure firewall settings to allow, block, or redirect traffic to specific ports or IP address.

## Inbound Rules

Inbound rules are based on the Protocol being used-TCP or UDP-the IP Address being accessed, and possibly the Port being used to access the IP address. The inbound rule may be a filter to remove access from getting to an internal machine based on the IP Address coming from.

## Outbound Rules

Outbound filtering can block or allow hosts through a system similar to how inbound rules may work. The outbound rules can block traffic from being sent out.
