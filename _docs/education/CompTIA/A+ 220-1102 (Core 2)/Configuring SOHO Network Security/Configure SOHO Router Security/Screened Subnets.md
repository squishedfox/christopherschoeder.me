# Screened Subnets

## Summary

The screened subnet is meant to help prevent an attack from a compromised machine which has been given access through port forwarding or firewall settings.

## Enterprise Networks

Enterprise networks resolved this issue by utilizing screened subnetting and secured by the Deprecated Terminology Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

In Enterprise networks some servers are put on a different subnet than other systems so they cannot easily access resources they should not be able to if they are compromised in any way.

## Home Networks

Home networks do not have the luxury of supporting multiple subnets using a single router setup, however the Deprecated Terminology Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) provides a way for home networks to solve this issues.

On home networks this refers to a computer on the LAN that is configured to receive communications for any ports that have not been forwarded to other hosts.
