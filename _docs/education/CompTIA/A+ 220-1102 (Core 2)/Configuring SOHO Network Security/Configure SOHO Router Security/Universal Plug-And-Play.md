# Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP)

## Summary

To deter users from simply disabling firewall rules to get an application to work correctly or any forwarding rules the Universal Plug and Play system was created to help users get passed issues they may be facing.

## Firewall

In some routers under advanced settings there is a checkbox or radio button which enabled UPnP that would provide access to home systems or servers trying to be access via a Wide Area Network (WAN) or they are trying to access the WAN themselves like an Xbox, Playstation, or Minecraft Server.

## Security

UPnP is the cause of many security vulnerability within a Network and thus should not be enabled when not necessary.
