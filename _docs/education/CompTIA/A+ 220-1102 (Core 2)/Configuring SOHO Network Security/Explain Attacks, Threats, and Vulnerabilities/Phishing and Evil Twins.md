# Phishing and Evil Twins

## Phishing 

Phishing is a means of sending out electronic communications which appear to be authentic to a consumer and convincing them to take action and provide information which may lead to further attacks on systems.

Phishing can also be a way of getting users to click on links which may install malware on their systems or spyware so the threat actors can continue to listen.

### Spear Phising

When a threat actor has specific parts of information about a user to make a message more authentic to the user when they send it, such as documents, phone numbers, addresses, jobs, etc. This is used as a way of gaining trust of the user.

### Whaling

Attacks which are used specifically against upper management or C-Level individuals

### Vishing

Visishing attacks take place over the phone where attackers try to gain access and information from users.
