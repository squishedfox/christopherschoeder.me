# Threat Types

## External versus Internal Threats

External threat actors come from outside a secure location. They may have no access or visibility to internal systems but have pieces of knowledge which may help them move past any barriers put in place to prevent them from entering.

Internal threat actors come from inside secure locations. They are employees, people whom are pretending to be someone else, or they may have been granted permissions

## Footprinting Threats

Threat actors whom intend to sell information about or possibly attack targets are called Footprint threats. Footprint threats may gather information through OSINT about the company or employees and finding ways to create impersonations of employees. They may also gain access to networks physically or through vulnerabilities and passively gather information about the networks.

## Spoofing Threats

Spoofing can happen in a various ways to convince a target that you are at a different location, a different systems, or person. Spoofing can take the form of MAC or IP Address, JSON, Web Tokens (JWTs), Auth Tokens, or sessions.

## On-path (Man in the Middle) Attacks

On-path (Man in the Middle) attacks are threat actors whom are acting as an inbetween for two networks. All traffic is directed through an attackers system which then gets logged and can later be analyized by the attacker.

## Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks limit a company or person's ability to perform regular activity in a given system. For instance a DoS attack can constantly send requests to a single Web Endpoint or computer which can cause it to either "fall over" meaning the service stops responding or shuts down, or it simply cannot respond to any other requests that have been given.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks and Botnets

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are attacks carried out from two or more systems-typically from computers which have been taken over (Bots) and are sending requests to a system without even knowing it.
