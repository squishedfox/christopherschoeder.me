# Vulnerabilities

Some fault or weakness than can be exploited by a threat actor. Vulnerabilities can be exploits found by good or bad actors, which can appear from poor design in software design and programming, system failures, social engineering, or workarounds.

## Non-compliant Systems

Settig up systems with baseline configurations reduces the attack surface-i.e. vulnerabilities-of a service or system.

Non compliance systems are ones that have changes or missing changes which no longer meet the harden requirements of their use. There are tools like vulnerability scanners which are design to help find and remediate systems which may be out of compliance.

## Unprotected Systems

Unprotected systems are created through missing configurations or missconfigured applications such as networks, firewalls, antivirus systems and scanners, or any additional malware detection systems.

## Software and Zero-day Vulnerabilities

A software vulnerability is a fault in design or in code that can cause an application security system to be circumventoed or that will cause th eapplication to crash. 

Vulnerabilities which are the worst, are the ones that allow users to execute scripts or pieces of code on hardware that were not inteded which can lead to undesired effects on systems.

## Bring Your Own Device Vulnerabilities (BYOD)

Bring your own device allows employees to use personal mobile devices to access corporate systems and data. Int his scenario, it is very difficult for security teams to identify secure configuration baselines for each time of device.
