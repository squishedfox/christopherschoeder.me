# Alarms and Surveillance

These devices are used to monitor areas with sophisticated technologies that can silently or actively alert staff.

## Different Types

- Circuit: Typically caused by when a system is connected or disconnected. This can be a door or window of sorts.
- Motion Sensors: Common motion sensors like Radar or PIR which can detect heat sources or radio waves.
- Proximity: Radio frequency (RFID) tags can be used to track movement within an area. This can be useful tro track equipment
- Duress: This type of alarm is triggered manually by staff if they come under threat.

## Video Surveillance

This is a great second layer of security design to improve the resilience of perimeter gateways.

## Lighting

Lighting is a critical piece of security for buildings which require physical security to be active and present at all times of the hours of the day, especially at night.
