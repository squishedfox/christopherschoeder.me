# Authentication Methods

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Multifactor authentication requires that a user must provide at least two ways that they are whom they say they are. 

### 2-step Verification

2-Step verification is a means of using a soft token to check that a sign-in request is authentication. It works on the following lines.

1. User registers a trusted contact method with the app, for example using an email, phone call, phone text, mobile device application, token provider device, or a hardware key.
2. User logs on the application-typically with a username and password
3. The user then will be redirected to another page which will request a mixture of numbers or letters that th euser must put in.
