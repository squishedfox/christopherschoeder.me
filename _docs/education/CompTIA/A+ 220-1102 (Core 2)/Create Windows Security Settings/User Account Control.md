# User Account Control

A tool that uses the last privilege principle to protect the computer from bad actors whom may be trying to exployt the system utalizing any type of scripting. This control requires that a user specifically provides elevated privliges for a single task to perform it's duties and then remove the elevated privlige afterwrads.

You may also run the `cmd` prompt using Administrator privliges which will allow the user to perform an action as if they were always in computer Administrator mode until the terminal session is closed.
