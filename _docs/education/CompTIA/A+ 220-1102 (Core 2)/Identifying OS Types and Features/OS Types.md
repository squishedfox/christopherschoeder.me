# OS Types

## Terms

**Business Client** An Operating System (OS) designed to work as a client in centrally managed business domain and networks.
**Network Operating System (NOS)** An Operating System (OS) design to run servers in business networks

**Cell Phone** an Operating System design to work with a handheld portable device. This type of Operating system must have a touch-operated interface.

## Windows 

Windows Provides workstation computers and home computer system

### NTFS

Runs on New Technology File System (NTFS) as a proprietary file system developed by Microsoft for use with Windows. It provides as a 64-bit addressing scheme, allowing for very large volumes and file sizes.

### FAT32

The FAT file system is a very early type named for the its method of organization-the file allocation table. The FAT provides links from one allocation unit to another. FAT32 is a variant of FAT that uses a 32-bit allocation.

### exFAT

exFAT is a 64-bit version of FAT designed for use with removable hard drives and flash media. Like NTFS, exFAT supports large volumes (128 petabytes) and files sizes (16 exabytes).

## MacOS

Apple provides an operating system which works specifically on their laptop computers or their all-in-one PC computers.

## Unix

Originally built by bell laboratories in the late 1960s. All UNIX systems share a kernel/shell architecture.

## Linux

Originally developed by LInux Torvalds. Linux is a fully open-source Operating System Kernel, derived from UNIX. Linux has additional features built on top of it's kernel system like a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

There are many different flavors of linux that have different built in security, feature, applications, and serve different purposes.

- Linux Suse
- Linux RedHat
- Linux Ubuntu
- Linux Mint (a flavor distro on top of Ubuntu)
- Linux CentOS
- Linux Backtrack/Kali Linux

### ext3

Most linux file systems support ext3-which is a 64-bit file system with support for journalism. ext4 delivers better performance than ext3 delivers and would usually represent the best choice for new systems. Linux also supports FAT and FAT32

## Chrome OS

The Chrome Operating System is derived from Linux via an open source Operating System called Chromium. The Chromebook and the Chromebox hardware are proprietary hardware built specifically with ChromeOS in mind. It is used primarily for low cost system to connect to a network and be able to access Google products and services in the cloud.

## IOS

### Apple iOS

iOS is the apple operating system running on their laptops, desktops, tables, and mobile devices. It's derived from unix systems and developed as a closed source system. This means that the code is closed source. 

### Apple iPadOS

The Apple iPadOS is developed more specifically to have multitasking functionality applied to the operating system.

### Apple File System

APFS (Apple File System) is a proprietary file system for Apple which supports journalism, snapshots, permissions/ownership, and encryption.

## Android

Android Operating Systems run on Table and Mobile devices. Android is primarily driven and produce by Google. It is an Open-Source Operating System which means that any contributor can make changes to the codebase. The Operating System is based on Linux.
