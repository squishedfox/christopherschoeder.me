# Ticket Management

## Summary

Tickets must be triaged to understand the severity and priority of which it should be resolved. Higher priority is given to issues which may be effecting larger amounts of users or products, these are called Escalation Levels.

## Communication

All communication to peers and end users should be done inside of the ticket, usually in the comments or discussions section, to provide updates and visibility to the submitter. 

Details should include

- Date and Time of Update
- What additional information was gathered
- The outcome of the investigation, meeting, or process
- Any timeline changes which may increase or decrease
- Any attachments or screenshots which may be used for evidence of completion or problems with triaging
