# Professional Support Delivery

## Be On Time

Arrive to your work location on time or to a meeting on time.

If you are late please simply apologize and move on

## Avoid Distractions

Any time you are on-site working with a customer avoid any unecessary interaction from any other peers.

## Deal Appropriately with Confidential and Private Materials

Any confidential materials which were produced during testing or attempting to solve the problem should say with the customer and not leave.
