# Professional Support Processes

## Proper Documentation

Proper documentation involves the issues that are involved, what systems or tools are involved, how long it will take to resolve an issue

## Set Execrations and Timeline

Many things can effect a timeline for resolutions. It's important to outline your findings, what you think the resolutions will be for each approach, and why you would act on one approach before another.

## Meet Expectations and Timeline

As you perform different actions make sure that you communicate your findings and provide updates for resolution.

## Followup

Always followup after resolving anything and ensure that the resolution that was applied is working and continuing to work.
