# System Requirements for Applications

## System Requirements

System Requirements are a way of describing the minimum resource requirements for a machine to run a piece of vendor software. Traditionally the requirements will spell out the needs for Random Access Memory (RAM), Central Processing Unit (CPU), and Storage to be able to install and successfully use the software. Some applications also have requirements such as needing to be running a 32-bit versus a 64-bit CPU architecture.
