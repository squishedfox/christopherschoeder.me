# Domain Setup

Computers can remain on their own WORKGROUP or they may join a Domain. When a computer joins the domain it then gains access and inherits resource access via the administrator's guidance and permissions of the network.

### Joining a Domain

Windows computers can only join a network domain after system installation or during an attended installation. After windows has installed if the current user joins the domain by going to Accounts and then clicking on **Access work or school account** they will then be asked if they want to join a domain and setup with a wizard to take them through the setps of entering their domain credentials to access the network and its resources.
