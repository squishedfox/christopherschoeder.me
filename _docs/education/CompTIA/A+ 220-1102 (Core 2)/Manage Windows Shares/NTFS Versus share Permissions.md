# NTFS Versus Share Permissions

when a sharing folder, the basic give access to interface concels some of the complexity of the Windows NTFS versus share permissions system

- Share-level permissions only apply to a folder accessed over the network. Users whom have access to the folder on the local machine or whom are logged in have access to the folders regardless if they have been shared or not.
- NTFS permissions are applied for both network and local access and can be applied to folders and to individual files.

Access for a folder on a local machine or network can be updated or remoted through the properties and advanced section of the folder. Through here you can change individual properties and sharing of the folder either through the network Active Directory Groups (AD Groups) or directly with the machine roles.

Folder permissions are below

- Read, List, Execute
- Write Permissions
- Modify permissions
- Full control
