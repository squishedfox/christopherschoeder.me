# Windows File Share Configuration

There are a few ways to share files on a windows system.

To share files locally on the same machine, move the resource to the **Public** folder so that other users may view or modify it

To share files over the network, it's also a good idea to move resources to the **Public** folder. From there you can go to **Advanced Sharing > settings > All networks > Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders**

## Sharing a specific folder

You can share just one specific folder on your machine if you do not want to use the **Public** folder. to do so you can

1. Right click on the resource folder to share
2. Click on the context menu item "give access to"
3. Search for an account or security group that may exist on the machine or in the network domain you are connected to. 
4. Modify the permissions to meet the requirements of the task. i.e. Read, or Read/Write
5. (Optionally) you can go to the **Share** tab of the above mentioned section and adjust permissions more granularly.
