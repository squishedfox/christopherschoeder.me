# Managing Linux

So far in this course, you worked mostly with the Microsoft Windows operating system. A CompTIA A+ technician should be capable of supporting diverse OS environments. The various operating systems you might encounter use different interfaces and command syntax, but the functionality of those tools is common across all types of systems. You will need to configure disks and file systems, user accounts, network settings, and software applications. 
Lesson Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Identify features of Linux.
- Identify features of macOS.

You should be able to identify features of Linux and macOS to help support diverse OS environments.

## Guidelines for Supporting Linux and macOS

Follow these guidelines to support Linux and macOS desktop and laptop users:

- Create knowledge base support documentation to assist users and technicians with command-line management of the following Linux features:
    - Shell/terminal concepts and man help system.
    - Directory navigation and file management (nano, cat, pwd, ls, mv, cp, rm, df, grep, find, and backups/cron).
    - User and permissions management (su/sudo, chmod, chown, and Samba file sharing).
    - Package and process management (apt-get, yum, ps, top, and antivirus/integrity checking for updates/patches).
    - Network management (ip and dig).
- Create knowledge base support documentation to assist users and technicians with use of the following macOS features:
    - User interface features (Dock, Finder, Spotlight Search, and Terminal).
    - User System Preference settings and configuration (Apple ID and corporate restrictions, privacy, accessibility, Keychain, Gestures, and Multiple Desktops/Mission Control).
    - Package and process management (installation and uninstallation of applications and .DMG, .PKG, .APP file types, antivirus/integrity checking, updates/patches, and force quit).
