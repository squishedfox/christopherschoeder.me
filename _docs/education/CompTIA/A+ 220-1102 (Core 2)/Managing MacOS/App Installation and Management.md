# App Installation and Management

Applications can be installed in one of three ways on Apple MacOS

## AppStore

Users need to be signed into their AppleID account to be able to install applications from the Apple Store. Applications and their settings are syncronized across devices when possible. 

## Downloading .dmg

Files with the .dmg extension can be installed on the Apple MacOS by downloading the file and then copying it over to the Applications folder of your Apple MacOS local disk. To uninstall an application you can open the Applications folder and then drag the icon into the trash bin. 

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a third-party package manager used by more technical individuals similar to other linux package managers. Applications installed using homebrew should not be mixed with applications installed using other methods as it may cause system issues.
