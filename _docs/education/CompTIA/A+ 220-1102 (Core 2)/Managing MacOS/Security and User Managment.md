# Security and User Management

## Apple ID

To access backups or various applications syncronizing across devices it's recommended to sign into your AppleID so that if your computer is compromised or has issues you can reset the computer and sign back in with everything where it was.

## Security and Privacy

Apple has great policies when it comes to security and privacy. They provide by-default support for disk encryption, with FileVault, on your system. You can change various granular controls and permissions on your machine such that each application must first be granted access to resources or objects before they can access them.

## Keychain

Keychain is a tool which helps secure and manage passwords and accounts on your Apple MacOS. This tool is used regularly whenever prompted to install an application and the system requires a password to access resources necessary for installation.
