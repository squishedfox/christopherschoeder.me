## Data Collection

Data collection is rampant and often many companies will attempt to fingerprint your activity with their website or partner websites to provide better "ad" experiences or to simply sell your information to data brokers.

## Pop-Up Blockers

Pop-ups are annoying. It's best to block all popu-up blockers which do not come from your corporate environment

## Ad blockers

u-block origin is the best

## Cache Clearing

It's best to always clear browser cache after use. That way you don't have stale data.
