# Browser Selection and Installation

## Major Browsers

As of 2023 the major browsers which users will utilize to access the internet are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.

## Trusted Sources

Browsers should only be installed directy from trusted sources such as Microsoft App Store, Apple Store, or mozilla.org.

## Untrusted Sources

It's important to follow application installtion security procedures the same for browsers as any other application.

- Verify the hash
- Verify that the application is signed correctly from the vendor it says it's from
- Go directly to the source of the vendor to get the application rather than any third-party.
