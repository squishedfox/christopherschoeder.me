# Secure Connections and Valid Certifications

## Digital Certificates

Certificate Authorities (CA)s are trusted third-party sources which sign digital certificates which are used to encrypt data to be safely sent over a network.

## Self-Signed Certificates

In some cases it may be required to create a self signed certificate for testing purposes. This certificate is not trusted by any other source other than your own machine, and often even requires an "exception" to be created inside of any browser to trust it in the first place.
