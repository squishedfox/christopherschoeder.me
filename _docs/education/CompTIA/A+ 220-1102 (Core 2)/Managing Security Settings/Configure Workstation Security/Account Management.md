-Reights or privileges control what system configuration changes a user can make to a PC

## Change Default Administrator Account and Password

For the most part, the root or administrator account is disabled after an Operation System is installed, however, if it is not you need to change the root or administrator password. This password should be setup and maintained by one person only.

## Disable Guest Accounts

Disabling Guest Accounts on a computer reduces the likeliness that someone can access a machine which as a connection to or stored sensative inforamtion which can be retrieved through any known or possible exploits.
