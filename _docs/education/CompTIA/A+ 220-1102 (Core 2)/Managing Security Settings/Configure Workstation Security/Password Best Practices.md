# Password Best Practices

Weak password policies still is one of the heighest risks for cybersecurity threats because there are still companies which cannot migrate towards using systems like Active Directory Account/Credential managment or use the benefits of 2-factor authentication.

## Password Rules

- Make the password sufficiently long: The longer the password, the longer it would take for a dictionary or bruteforce attack to guess the password.
- Chose a memorable phrase, but do not use any personal information: users whom can remember their password can help by not exposing their credential elsewhere like a spreadsheet on the internet.
- Password rotation should be enforced, meaning that users should have to change their passwords given a period of time: rotating passwords can reduce the likelihood that a comprimised account continues to go unoticed.

## BIOS/UEFI Passwords

System passwords can be enabled and configured through the BIOS settings on computer startup. Not all systems have this feature enabled, although more modern systems will have them available. 

Systems which have EUFI enabled may not necessarily be systems which are user logged in, but rather run at long periods of time and require authentication into the system itself.
