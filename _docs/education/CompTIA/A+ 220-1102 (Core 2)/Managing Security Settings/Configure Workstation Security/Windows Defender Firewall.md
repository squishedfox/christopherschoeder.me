- Port Security - exposes or blocks incoming or outgoing requests from a system. It is best to close any unused ports on a system to prevent any exploits from being used.
- Application Security - triggerd based on processes that listen for system connections.
- Address - triggers based on IP or FQDN of the server or client hosts.
