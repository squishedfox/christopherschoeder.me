# Malware Infection Prevention

## Configure On-Access Scanning

On Access scanning will scan a file before execution to make sure it does not contain any malicious code. This is only effective the first time the file is ran, and does not have any benefits after the system has already been compromised.

## Configure Scheduled Scans

It is good to scan your system regularly to make sure tha tyou do not have any malware which may have managed to enter your system

## Re-anable System Restore and Services

If you had to disable system restore you will want to

1. Create a new restore point and cleanup backup data.
2. Ensure that any other configurations or system controls which may not have been completely are put back to their working state.
3. Validate that your DNS settings are restored to their defaults and there is no in-between DNS spoofing happening
4. Ensure that any firewall settings which may have been disabled by the software are up and running.
