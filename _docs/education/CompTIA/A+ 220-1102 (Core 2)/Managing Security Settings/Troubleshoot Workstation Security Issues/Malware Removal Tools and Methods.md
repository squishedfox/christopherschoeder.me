# Malware Removal Tools and Methods

## Virus Removal Software

If the Anti-virus software has successfully detected the piece of malware and been able to quarantine it then you can use the software to remove the malware. If it has not detected it you can try and update the anti-virus software, although that database may no longer be working as malware may be sophisticated enough to bock the update of your anti-virus software.

## Recovery Mode

You may need to get your thinking hat on! Time to start the manual process.

1. Go into any system processes either though terminal/command or using a graphical user interface such as Task Manager.
2. Look for any suspicious software that may be running. Look for names that don't sound familiar to you or may not exist on the system.
3. use `msconfig` to perform a safe boot or boot into safe made to prevent the malware from starting up
4. If you have the original media for system installation such as a CD-ROM or USB this is the time to plug it into the system and re-install your Operating System Files.

## OS ReInstallation

Some malware is sophisticated enough to even stick around after doing the previously mentioned steps-virus removal and recovery mode practices. In this case you will want to use your CD-ROM or USB and completely wipe the system drive. Reformat the disk and all.
