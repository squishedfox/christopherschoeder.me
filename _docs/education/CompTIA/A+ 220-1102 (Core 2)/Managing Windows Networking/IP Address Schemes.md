## IPv4

IPv4 uses four octets which a combined 32-bit address, and a 32-bit subnet mask. Both of which are typically entered in dotted decimal notation. 

### Examples

- Home Network systems: 192.168.1.51 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
- Corporate Network Systems: 10.10.32.232 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.100
- Wide Network Systems (WAN): 172.132.221.23 (no idea for what a subnet mask would be)
## IPv6

IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses with the interface portion being 64-bits. Network prefixes are used to identify logical networks with the first 64-bits.

## Static Versus Dynamic

Static IP addresses are provided to a machine/client automatically based on routing rules and MAC Addresses, or just on the machine itself. Dynamic Addresses use the DHCP protocal (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocal) where the machine gets an address assigned everytime it requests one.
