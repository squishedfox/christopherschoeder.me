# Network Location

## Summary

Each network connection is governed by the local Operating System (OS) firewall settings. When you connect the Network Location Awareness (NLA) service prompts you to set the network type. The network type (public, private, or workplace) will help you configure your system settings to properly expose the common information required of that network type.
