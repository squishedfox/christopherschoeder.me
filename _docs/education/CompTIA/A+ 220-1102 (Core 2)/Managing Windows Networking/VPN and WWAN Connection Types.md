# VPN and WWAN Connection Types

## Virtual Private Networks (VPN)s

Virtual Private Networks allow systems to connect to a network which may have private resources that belong to a person or organization. Virtual Private Networks are tunnels from public networks into "owned" networks. Users must first be authenticated and authorized to connect to the network using a public/private key pair or by providing username and password credentials.

## Wireless Wide Area Network Connection (WWAN)

Cellular adapters to connect to the internet via a provider's network is identified as a WWAN. The bandwidth of these networks greatly depend on the consuming device, range, and placement of the tower itself. Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) cards provide a way for Cellular networks to view who is connecting and where. These are required for systems to understand that you are authorized to connect to the network.
