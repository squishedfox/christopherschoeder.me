Angel brought in the new tablet he just purchased and tried to connect to the corporate network. He knows the SSID of the wireless network and the password used to access the wireless network. He was denied access, and a warning message was displayed that he must contact the IT Department immediately. What happened, and why did he receive the message?

1. You are attempting to run a command but receive the message “The requested operation requires elevation.” What must you do to run the command?
2. Which Windows command is probably best suited for scripting file backup operations?
3. Is the command format `d: /fs:exfat /q` valid? If so, what is its effect, and what precaution might you need to take before running it?
4. How do you perform a scan to identify file system errors in read-only mode?
5. Why might you run the shutdown command with the /t switch?
