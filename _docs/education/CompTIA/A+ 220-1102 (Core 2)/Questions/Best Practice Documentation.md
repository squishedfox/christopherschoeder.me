    - question: "<p>You are writing a proposal to improve a companyâ€™s current support procedures with a ticketing system. You have identified the following requirements for information that each ticket should capture. Following the CompTIA A+ objectives, what additional field or data point should be captured?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User information</li>
      <li>Device information</li>
      <li>Problem description/Progress notes/Problem resolution</li>
      <li>Categories</li>
      <li>Escalation levels</li>
    </ul>"
      answer: "This list contains no means of recording the severity of the ticket. This field is important for prioritizing issues."
    - question: "What role do barcodes play in managing inventory?"
      answer: "An inventory is a list of assets stored as database records. You must be able to correlate each physical device with an asset record by labeling it. A barcode label is a good way of doing this. "
    - question: "What are the two main types of network topology diagrams?"
      answer: "You can create diagrams to show the physical topology or the logical topology. The physical topology shows how nodes are connected by cabling. The logical topology shows IP addresses and subnets/VLANs. There are lots of other types of network topology diagrams, of course, but physical and logical are the two basic distinctions you can make. It is best practice not to try to create a diagram that shows both as this is likely to reduce clarity."
    - question: "What is the purpose of a KB?"
      answer: "A knowledge base (KB) is a reference to assist with installing, configuring, and troubleshooting hardware and software. KBs might be created by vendors to support their products. A company might also create an internal KB, populated with guidelines, procedures, information from service tickets, and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs)."
    - question: "The contract ended recently for several workers who were hired for a specific project. The IT department has not yet removed those employees' login accounts. It appears that one of the accounts has been used to access the network, and a rootkit was installed on a server. You immediately contact the agency the employee was hired through and learn that the employee is out of the country, so it is unlikely that this person caused the problem. What actions do you need to take?"
      answer: "You need to create an incident report, remove or disable the login accounts, isolate the infected server and possibly any user computers that communicate with the server, and remove the rootkit from the server. In terms of wider security policies, investigate why the temporary accounts were not disabled on completion of the project."
