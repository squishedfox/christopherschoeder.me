question:
    - question: "A company must deploy custom browser software to employees’ workstations. What method can be used to validate the download and installation of this custom software?"
      answer: "The package can be signed using a developer certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority. Alternatively, a cryptographic hash of the installer can be made, and this value can be given to each support technician. When installing the software, the technician can make his or her own hash of the downloaded installer and compare it to the reference hash."
    - question: "A security consultant has recommended blocking end-user access to the chrome://flags browser page. Does this prevent a user from changing any browser settings?"
      answer: "No. The chrome://flags page is for advanced configuration settings. General user, security, and privacy settings are configured via chrome://settings."
    - question: "What primary indicator must be verified in the browser before using a web form?"
      answer: "That the browser address bar displays the lock icon to indicate that the site uses a trusted certificate. This validates the site identity and protects information submitted via the form from interception."
    - question: "True or false? Using a browser’s incognito mode will prevent sites from recording the user’s IP address."
      answer: "False. Incognito mode can prevent the use of cookies but cannot conceal the user’s source IP address. You do not need to include this in your answer, but the main way to conceal the source IP address is to connect to sites via a virtual private network (VPN)."
