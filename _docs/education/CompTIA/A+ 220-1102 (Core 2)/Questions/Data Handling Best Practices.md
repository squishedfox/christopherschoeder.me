questions:
    - question: "You are updating data handling guidance to help employees recognize different types of regulated data. What examples could you add to help identify healthcare data?"
      answer: "Personal healthcare data is medical records, insurance forms, hospital/laboratory test results, and so on. Healthcare information is also present in de-identified or anonymized data sets."
    - question: "An employee has a private license for a graphics editing application that was bundled with the purchase of a digital camera. The employee needs to use this temporarily for a project and installs it on her computer at work. Is this a valid use of the license?"
      answer: "No. The license is likely to permit installation to only one computer at a time. It might or might not prohibit commercial use, but regardless of the license terms, any installation of software must be managed by the IT department."
    - question: "Why are the actions of a first responder critical in the context of a forensic investigation?"
      answer: "Digital evidence is difficult to capture in a form that demonstrates that it has not been tampered with. Documentation of the scene and proper procedures are crucial."
    - question: "What does chain-of-custody documentation prove?"
      answer: "Who has had access to evidence collected from a crime scene and where and how it has been stored."
    - question: "Your organization is donating workstations to a local college. The workstations have a mix of HDD and SSD fixed disks. There is a proposal to use a Windows boot disk to delete the partition information for each disk. What factors must be considered before proceeding with this method?"
      answer: "Using standard formatting tools will leave data remnants that could be recovered in some circumstances. This might not be considered high risk, but it would be safer to use a vendor low-level format tool with support for Secure Erase or Crypto Erase."
