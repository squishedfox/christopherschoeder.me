questions:
    - question: "You are supporting a user who has installed a vendor keyboard driver. The keyboard no longer functions correctly. Under Windows 10, what are the steps to revert to the previous driver?"
      answer: "Open Device Manager from the WinX menu, Instant Search, or the Computer Management console. Expand Keyboards, then right-click the device and select Properties. On the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver."
    - question: "You are troubleshooting an issue with a wireless adapter. When you open Device Manager, you find the device's icon is shown with a down arrow superimposed. What does this mean, and why might this configuration have been imposed?"
      answer: "The icon indicates that the device has been disabled. It could be that there was a fault, or there may be a network configuration or security reason for disabling the adapter. In this sort of situation, use incident logs and device documentation to establish the reason behind the configuration change."
    - question: "If a single physical disk is divided into three partitions, how many different file systems can be supported?"
      answer: "Threeâ€”each partition can use a different file system."
    - question: "True or false? The dfrgui.exe utility should be disabled if Windows is installed to an SSD."
      answer: "False. While solid state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) have different mechanical and performance characteristics, it is still necessary to run the Defragment and Optimize Drives (dfrgui.exe) periodically to optimize performance."
    - question: "In Windows, what is the difference between the boot partition and the system partition?"
      answer: "The system partition contains the boot files; the boot partition contains the system root (OS files). The boot partition is normally assigned the drive letter C. The system partition is not normally assigned a drive letter."
