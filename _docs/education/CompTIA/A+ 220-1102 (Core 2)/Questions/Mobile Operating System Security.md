questions:
    - question: "What two types of biometric authentication mechanism are supported on smartphones?"
      answer: "Fingerprint recognition and facial recognition."
    - question: "True or false? Updates are not necessary for iOS devices because the OS is closed source."
      answer: "False. Closed source just means that the vendor controls development of the OS. It is still subject to updates to fix problems and introduce new features."
    - question: "A company wants to minimize the number of devices and mobile OS versions that it must support but allow use of a device by employees for personal email and social networking. What mobile deployment model is the best fit for these requirements?"
      answer: "Corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) will allow standardization to a single device and OS. As the requirement does not specify a single device and OS, choose your own device (CYOD) would also fit."
    - question: "The marketing department has refitted a kitchen area and provisioned several smart appliances for employee use. Should the IT department have been consulted first?"
      answer: "Yes. Uncontrolled deployment of network-enabled devices is referred as shadow IT. The devices could increase the network attack surface and expose it to vulnerabilities. The devices must be deployed in a secure configuration and monitored for security advisories and updates."
