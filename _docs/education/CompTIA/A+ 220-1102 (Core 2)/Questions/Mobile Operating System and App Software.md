questions:
    - question: "True or false? A factory reset preserves the user's personal data."
      answer: "False. Restoring to factory settings means removing all user data and settings."
    - question: "You are updating an internal support knowledge base with advice for troubleshooting mobile devices. What is the first step to take if a user reports that an app will not start?"
      answer: "Use force stop if available and/or reboot the device."
    - question: "You are troubleshooting a user device that keeps powering off unexpectedly. You run hardware diagnostics and confirm there is no component fault or overheating issue. What should your next troubleshooting step be?"
      answer: "Check that the device has sufficient spare storage, and check for updates. If you canâ€™t identify a device-wide fault, test to see whether the issue is associated with use of a single app."
