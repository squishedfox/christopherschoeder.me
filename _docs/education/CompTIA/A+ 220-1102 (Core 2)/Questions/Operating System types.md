questions:
    - question: "Apart from Windows and macOS, what operating system options are there for client PCs installed to a local network?"
      answer: "The other main choice is one of the distributions of Linux. A company might also use some sort of UNIX. Finally, Chrome OS is installed on Chromebox PCs. These are often used by educational institutions and businesses that rely primarily on web applications rather than locally installed desktop software."
    - question: "You are advising a customer with an older-model Android smartphone. The customer wants to update to the latest version of Android, but using the update option results in a 'No updates available' message. What type of issue is this, and what advice can you provide?"
      answer: "This is an issue with update limitations. Android is quite a fragmented market, and customers must depend on the handset vendor to implement OS updates for a particular model. The customer can only check the handset vendor's website or helpline to find out if a version update will ever be supported for that model."
    - question: "What feature of modern file systems assists recovery after power outages or OS crash events?"
      answer: "Journaling means that the file system keeps a log of updates that it can use to recover damaged data. The OS might also make use of snapshot capability to maintain a file-version history or perform continuous backups."
    - question: "A customer asks whether an iOS app that your company developed will also work on her Apple macOS computer. What issue does this raise, and what answer might you give?"
      answer: "The issue here is compatibility between different operating systems. Even though both are produced by Apple, iOS and macOS use different environments, so the iOS app cannot necessarily be installed directly. Your company might make a macOS version. However (do not worry if you did not include this in your answer), with the latest versions of macOS, there is support for native iOS apps, so this might be something you can offer."
