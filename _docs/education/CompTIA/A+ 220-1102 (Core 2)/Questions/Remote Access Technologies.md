questions:
    - question: "You are updating a procedure that lists security considerations for remote access technologies. One of the precautions is to check that remote access ports have not been opened on the firewall without authorization. Which default port for VNC needs to be monitored?"
      answer: "Virtual Network Computing (VNC) uses TCP port 5200 by default."
    - question: "True or false? You can configure a web server running on Linux to accept remote terminal connections from clients without using passwords."
      answer: "True. This can be configured using public key authentication with the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The server can be installed with the public keys of authorized users."
    - question: "You are joining a new startup business that will perform outsourced IT management for client firms. You have been asked to identify an appropriate software solution for off-site support and to ensure that service level agreement (SLA) metrics for downtime incidents are adhered to. What general class of remote access technology will be most suitable?"
      answer: "Remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools are principally designed for use by managed service providers (MSPs). As well as remote access and monitoring, this class of tools supports management of multiple client accounts and billing/reporting."
    - question: "Users working from home need to be able to access a PC on the corporate network via RDP. What technology will enable this without having to open the RDP port to Internet access?"
      answer: "Configure a virtual private network (VPN) so that remote users can connect to the corporate LAN and then launch the remote desktop protocol (RDP) client to connect to the office PC."
