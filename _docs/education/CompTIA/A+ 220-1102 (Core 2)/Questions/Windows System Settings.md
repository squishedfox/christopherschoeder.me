questions:
  - question: "You are assisting a user over the phone and need to identify the edition of Windows that is installed. What step instructions must you give for the user to report this information to you?"
    answer: "Open the Settings app, and then select System. Select the About section, and read the text next to Edition under the Windows specifications heading."
  - question: "While troubleshooting an issue with a graphics card in Windows 10, you discover that the driver version is not up to date. What first step could you perform to install the latest driver?"
    answer: "In the Settings app, select Update & Security. Under Windows Update, select \"View optional updates.\" If a graphics driver update is not listed here, check the vendorâ€™s site for driver installation software."
  - question: "A Windows user is trying to join a video conference and cannot hear any sound from her headset. Which tool can you suggest using to try to remedy the fault?"
    answer: "Use the Sound settings app or Control Panel applet to check the volume setting and that the headset is configured as the input and output device. If the headset is not listed, check the USB or Bluetooth connection."
  - question: "You are assisting a laptop user. While the user was away from their desk, the laptop powered off. The user was in the middle of working on a file and forgot to save changes. Can you reassure the user and advise on the best course of action?"
    answer: "When a computer goes into a power-saving mode, it will either maintain a small amount of power to the memory modules or write the contents of memory to a hibernation file on disk. Consequently, the user should be able to start the laptop again, and the desktop will resume with the open file still there. You should advise the customer to save changes to files regularly, however."
