questions:
  - question: "You are assisting a home user who wants her spouse to be able to sign in to a new Windows laptop using a Microsoft account. Is this possible, and if so, which management interface is used?"
    answer: "Yes, this can be done via the Accounts settings app. The legacy User Accounts applet in Control Panel can no longer be used to add accounts. "
  - question: "True or false? Under default settings, the user account added during setup is not affected by User Account Control."
    answer: "False. User Account Control (UAC) is designed to prevent misuse of accounts with administrative privileges. Use of such privileges requires the user to approve a consent dialog or to enter the credentials of an administrator account. This system can be disabled via UAC settings, but it is enabled by default."
  - question: "A user calls to say that he clicked Yes to a prompt to allow the browser to access the computerâ€™s location service while using a particular site and is now worried about personal information being tracked by other sites. How can the user adjust the app permission in Windows?"
    answer: "Via the App permissions section under Privacy settings. You might also note that most browser software can be configured to only allow location information on a per-site basis."
  - question: "You need to assist a user in changing the extension of a file. Assuming default Explorer view settings, what steps must the user take?"
    answer: "The user must first show file extensions, using the View tab in the File Explorer Options applet (you might also note that this can be done via a check box on the View menu ribbon of File Explorer)."
