# Internet of Things (IoT) Security

## Summary

IoT devices are small embedded systems which typically have a single purpose such as turning on and off a lamp in a room, taking weather measurements, or reporting PH levels in a water cooling tank.

## Home Automation Systems

- Hub/control System - Most IoT devices are considered to be "Headless" and thus do not actually have a user control interface. They work off the data which comes from a network.
- Smart device types - Smart devices are ones that exist to assist humanity in simple tasks such as doorbells, thermostats/heating controls, referidgerator systems, etc. 
- Wireless mesh networking - Mesh networks are internal nodes to a network which allow communication between devices 


## Security Concerns

IoT devices expose personal network due to laziness and poor configuration. Lack of default changed settings may expose the network to other attacks and let threat actors expose common issues known to that device or brand.
