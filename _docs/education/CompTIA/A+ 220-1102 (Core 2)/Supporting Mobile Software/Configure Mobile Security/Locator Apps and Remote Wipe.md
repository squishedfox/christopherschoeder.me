# Locator Apps and Remote Wipe

## Locator Apps

Many mobile devices have Global Position Systems (GPS)s on them which enable the ability to find them if they are lost or you are using an application which may require your location. If location is not enabled on the device then typically the nearest provider tower is the deemed location.

## Remote Wiping

Remote wiping devices is an important task and ability to perform on a device. It allows the deletion or scrambling of information on a device so that it cannot be used to crack or obtain any secrets or information about you or any other parties which may be attached to that device.
