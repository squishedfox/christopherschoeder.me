# Mobile Data Security

## Device Encryption

All devices should be encrypted by default with their storage units. Anytime data can be encrypted either at rest or intransit it should be.

for mobile devices the data remains encrypted until it is read. Part of the key is not unlocked until the device is unlocked.
