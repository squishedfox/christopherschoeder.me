# Mobile Security Software

## Patching/Operating System (OS) Updates

It is important to update your mobile devices as often as you would your desktop or laptop workstations. The mobile devices require additonal software to protected against threat actors which may attempt to use an exploit to gain access to a system.

## Antivirus/Anti-malware

Mobile devices typically have a more difficult time trying to filter out content than traditional workstations such as desktops and laptops. The landscape for software provided to mobile devices for technology solutions and use cases makes the attack surfaces much larger.

Much of the anti-malware/software works as a content filter or blocker than it does anti-malware itself.
