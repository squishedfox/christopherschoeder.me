# Screen Locks

## Summary

Just like with Desktop or Laptops, it's good to have a default timeout for the screen to lock after a user is inactive. This is to prevent physical access attacks on a device.

## Screen Lock Protections

- Biometrics
- Pin or password
- Facial Recognition
- Pattern(s)/Puzzels

## Lock Attempts

It is best to lock your device after so many attempts at trying to unlock it for protection.
