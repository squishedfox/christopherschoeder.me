# Mobile App Source Security Concerns

## App Spoofing

App spoofing is similar to an "evil twin" attack. Applications will pretend to look legitimate however 

## Enterprise Apps and APK Sideloading

Some enterprise applications need to be sideloaded onto a mobile device. This means loading an application through a different app store or directly downloading an SDK from a enterprise managed portal and installing the application onto the mobile device.

## Bootleg App Stores

Bootleg app stores are apps which have either been cracked and pirated directly from the paid app store, or they are apps which very closely mimic the full functionality of another application.
