# Mobile Security Symptoms

## Summary

Just like mobile device counterparts, workstations such as desktops and laptops, mobile devices can run into a collection of similar issues which can be diagnosed and identified in different ways.

## Common Issues

- High number of ads - if there are ads which are overridding the ability to use the application or other applications like popups, browsers opening, requesting additional privileges on a system, these are all signs that a application may be attempting to attack your mobile device.
- Fake security warnings - fake security warnings are a way to provide a sense of urgency to the user to take action, typically the bad action that a threat actor wants you to take, such as downloading a piece of software, or installing extensions into your browser.
- Sluggish response time - Slow mobile devices may be having issues becuase there is undesired software running into the background.
- limited/no internet connectivity - Malware often will try and spoof DNS or search providers and force you to use a search provider which they may want you to use so they can capture traffic or information.
