# Root Access Security Concerns

## Terms

- Root Access - root access is a way of providing an executing user or software with the ability to run any program they want on the operating system.
- Jailbreak - jailbreaking allows users to change their device outside of what the device was designed for by the vendor. iOS devices are more challenging and restrictive to jailbreak than android devices.

## Other Notes

- When you jailbreak devices or provide root access you are bypassing built-in security systems which were made to protect the device
