# Mobile Device Troubleshooting Tools

## Reboot

Rebooting a device is often a successful tactic when attempting to resolve an issue. The device is wiped of any malicious applications or programs that may be running and loaded into RAM, or possibly passive, corrupt applications.

## Factory Reset

If the device is unresponsive or having issues it may be time for a factory reset.

1. Backup all contacts, files, accounts, and settings on the phone
2. Follow the manufacture instructions to do a hard reset
3. Asssist the user in re-configuring their phone and re-establishing their accounts, files, and settings.
