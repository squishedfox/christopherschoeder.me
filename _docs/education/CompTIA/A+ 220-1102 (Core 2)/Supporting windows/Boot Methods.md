# Boot Methods

## Summary

Boot methods are ways in which a system can boot up. Examples of Booting into a system can be via media storage device like a USB stick, CD, or PXE over the Network. Each firmware setup on a computer can provide a way for the machine to give priority to one boot method or another. For example you may want to check Disk 1 on the machine for an operating system, if there is non, move to the USB device, and then to the Optical Device, and finally to your Network until an image can finally be loaded or recoganized as loadable onto the system.
