# Repair Installation

## Recovery Partitions

The recovery partition is a tool used by OEMs to restore the Operating System (OS) environment to its ship state. The recovery partition is created on the internal fixed drive. If there are fatal errors with the operating system such as random drivers failing, or perhaps facing issues with performance, then it may be worth while to do a system recovery and restore the operating system files to their factory settings.

Restoring to factory settings doesn't mean just deleting all user data. When doing a Windows Recovery Process you can chose to either keep all the user data and files as-is, or simply delete all of them and start fresh.
