# Unattended Installations

## Summary

Unattended Installations were created as a way of being able to install entire operating systems on machines, or pieces of software with little to no input required from the user. the benefit is that the User no longer has to continue to monitor the system's progress. 

## Images

Images were created as part of the unattended installation process as a way to be able to create consistent machine setups throughout larger enterprise workstation groups.
