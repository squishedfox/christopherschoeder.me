# Troubleshooting Name Resolution

**Security** Firewall or other security software or hardware might be blocking the connection or proxy settings might be misconfigured
**Name Resolution** if a service such as a Domain Name Server (DNS) is not working you will be able to connect to servers by IP address but not by name
**Application/OS** The software underpinning the service might have failed. If the Operating System (OS) has failed, there might not be any soft of connectivity to the host server.

## nslookup command

IF you identify or suspect a problem with name resolution, you can troubleshoot Domain Name Server (DNS) issues with the `nslookup` command, either interactively or from the command prompt using `nslookup -Option Host Server`
