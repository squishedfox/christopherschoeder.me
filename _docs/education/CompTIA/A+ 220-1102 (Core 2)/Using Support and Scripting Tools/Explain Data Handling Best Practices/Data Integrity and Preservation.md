# Data Integrity and Preservation

## Digital Forensics

Digital Forensics Specialists is the study of finding evidence/information which may be relevant to a breach of secure parameters setup throughout an organization.

Digital Forensics Specialists will often be employed with private agencies or law enforcement agencies.

Digital Forensics Specialists will also need to collaborate with any team members or managers to gain access or request information to put together a report/story of the incident.

## Documentation of Incident and Recovery Evidence

1. Work to find the systems or threat actors which may be involved in the incident. When possible isolate any compromised accounts, systems, or networks from anything else. You may not want to directly take them offline as that may flag that you are onto finding out who the threat actor may be.
2. Create a streamline of documentation for yourself and others using any screen shots, photographs, videos, attachments, etc. which can support your findings.
3. Capture any digital fingerprints which may relate to the incident such as logs, memory dumps, cache, storage backups or snapshots, etc.
4. Power off devices that may no longer be necessary for the investigation
5. Gather any copies of accounts or systems necessary for later reporting or to attempt to reproduce an issue
6. Make a cryptographic hash of each source disk and its forensic image for possible evidence later.
7. Collect any physical devices, machines, etc.

## Chain of Custody

Chain of Custody is a way of documenting where, when, and who collected the evidence being presented or documented. Chain of Custody is a way of creating another audit trail for anyone else coming into the report to understand who helped generated it or oif there was any tamporing with it.
