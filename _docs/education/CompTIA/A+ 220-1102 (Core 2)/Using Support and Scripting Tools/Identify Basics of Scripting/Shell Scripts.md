# Shell Scripts

## Summary

Shells scripts can refer to bash scripts or to powershell scripts which can be ran on various systems to automate a task. There are other programming languages which can be used to script changes but these are the two most common.

## Concepts

In general shell scripts are used to communicate to an Operating System using the OS APIs and calls. Over time these can be deprecated so they need to be checked and updated regularly to ensure they continue to function as expected.
