# Backup Operations

## Summary

Backups refer to the storage of files and accounts to a seperate server elsewhere. Depending on the setup and system you may have your accounts and files put on a Network Access Storage (NAS) which will hold onto files and your account stored within Active Directory or a similar system like Google Accounts, or Apple Accounts.

## Scheduling

It's important to schedule backups regularly. For enterprise accounts you should be syncing often as you never know when a user system could be compromised or corrupted. For Home networks you should also attempt to backup your files often.
