# Backup Testing and Recovery Practices

## Testing

- Try restoring some of the backed-up data into a test directory or system.
- Configure the backup software after restoring it and ensure it functions as expected.

## When to Test

You should test whenever there is a change in how you perform backups or when a backup type is introduced into an environment.
