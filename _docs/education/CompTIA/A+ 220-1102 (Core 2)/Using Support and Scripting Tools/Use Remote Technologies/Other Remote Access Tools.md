# Other Remote Access Tools

## Screen Sharing Software

Third party vendor software for windows can be used like LogMeIn and TeamViewer allow for peer-to-peer access without making any configured changes to a network or system firewall.

These apps are considered to be secure as they work over the 443 (SSL/TLS) port on a system which is a commonly open port on any system.

While the software is installed it still requires that the party attempting to make the remote connetion have some sort of authentication like a PIN or username/password.

## Video-Conferencing Software

Microsoft Teams is the first party vendor software for Windows, however you may want to use other software such as Google Meet which works in the browser, or Zoom which works similar to Microsoft Teams that it can be installed on the local system or run through a browser.

## File Transfer Software FTP

File Transfer Software works to move files between a public server or a private server on a network. These files by default are connected to over port 22 (which is an open port on most systems by default). Port 21 is not considered to be a secure port and will send traffic unencrypted.
