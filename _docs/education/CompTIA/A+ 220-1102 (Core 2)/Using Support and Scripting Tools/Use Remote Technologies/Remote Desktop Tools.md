# Remote Desktop Tools

## Summary

Remote desktop tools can come in different varieties. There are terminal based tools and there are graphical based tools. Each tool may be used for a different purposes. 

In some cases the choice will be made for you as a server or system may not have a graphical user interface installed and you must use a terminal based system.

## Security Considerations

- Remote access permissions should be granted to accounts selectively using least privilege principles.
- Remote access should always be over a secure port and connection. You should always ensure that data is encrypted between systems and that you are indeed connected to the system you think you are connected to.
- Each system must support the connection correctly. Connecting to another system may also expose your own system to attacks so chose wisely.
