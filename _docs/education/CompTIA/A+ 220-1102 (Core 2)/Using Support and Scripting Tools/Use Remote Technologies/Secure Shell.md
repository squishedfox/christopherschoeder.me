# Secure Shell

Secure Shell (SSH) is a terminal based connection into a remote system. It uses TCP over port 22 by default. 

## Security

SSH is established through a symetric public/private key pair. As long as the server has your public key as a "trusted key" then the connection is allowed and each system is able to communicate.

## Username/Password

Even if you are able to connect to a system you may still require additional privileges or need to still sign in using a username and pasword, or you may just simply need to only use a username or password.
