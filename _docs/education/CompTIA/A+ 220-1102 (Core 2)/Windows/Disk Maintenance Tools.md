# Disk Maintenance Tools

## Summary

Tools that provide ways to maintain a working and performant order of files stored on disk.

## Problems

- Fragmentation: Files become fragmente across different clusters of the disk and thus make it take longer to read or find those files.
- Capacity: High disk usage means that there can be slower read because it takes longer to do a full disk scan for the content that is being requested.
- Damage: Hard disks may suffer damage to the mechanisms that read or possibly the disk itself that is being read due to over use leading to corrupt files on the system. Solid State Drives (SSD)s face the problem of degration over time and no longer can hold memory state as they are used more and more.
