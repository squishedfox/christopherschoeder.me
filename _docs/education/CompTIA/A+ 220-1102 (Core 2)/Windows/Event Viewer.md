# Event Viewer

# Summary

Provides a high level way to filter through the database logs of all the audits that have taken place in the system level.

## Layout

The event viewer is a snap-in that lets user view logcs based on security, System, User, Application, or other uncategorized logs.

## Troubleshooting

The Event Viwer is a great tool to look at when there are unexpected erorrs that occur in an application or the operating system commands. It can tell you additional details like strack traces in the software, or provide better breadcrumbs to track down additional details of the erorr.
