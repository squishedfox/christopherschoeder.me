# Compare and Contrast Dynamic Routing Concepts

# Objectives

1.4 Given a scenario, configure a subnet and use appropriate IP address schemes.
2.2 Compare and contrast routing technologies and bandwidth management concepts.

## Dynamic Routing Protocols

Dynamic routing protocols focus on the ability to build routing information at each router and the path priority for different network traffic. Information can be shared with peer routers.
