# Cable Management

## Distribution Frame Types

- **66 Block** - legacy block for terminating old phone style lines at the wall. Setup as 50 rows of 4 IDC terminals. Bridge connections are made between the 25 twisted pair cabling and the terminal to complete the connection.
- **110 Block** - Supports Cat5 and beyond cabling. The wiring is distributed horizontally which creates more room for density than block 66. Uses a two piece design.
- **BIX and Krone Distribution Frames** - Uses a single module. Common in North America. Competitor to 110 Block created by AT&T.
- **Patch Panel/Patch Bay** - Patch Panels create interfaces for simplifying connections. This is because there is no punch down terminal, only open wires to different connects on the panel.


## Terms

- Insultation-displacement-connection (IDC) - terminates twisted pair cabling at a wall plate or patch panel avaialble in different formats.
- Punch down block - a distribution frame that provides high density and available in different **IDC** formats
