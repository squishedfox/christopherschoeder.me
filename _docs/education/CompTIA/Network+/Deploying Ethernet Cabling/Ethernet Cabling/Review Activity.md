# Review Activity: Ethernet Cabling

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/904229422/network-ethernet-cabling-flash-cards/?i=3896f3&x=1jqt)

1.    Which types of distribution frame are best suited to 100 MHz or better operation?
> 110, BIX, and Krone blocks

2. What type of distribution frame is best suited to cabling wall ports to Ethernet switches in way that best supports futures changes?

> a patch panel allows wall ports to be connected to switches via patch cords. If a switch is replaced or if a wall port needs to be connected to a different switch port, the change can be made easily by moving a patch cord.

3. What tool is used to terminate wiring at a 110 block?

> A punchdown tool is used to connect wires via insulation displacement connectors (IDCs). You must use a suitable blade for the IDC format (110, Krone, or BIX).

4. At what layer of the OSI model does a fiber distribution panel work? 

> All types of distribution frames work at the physical layer (layer 1).

5. You need to provision modular SFP+ transceivers to support a 10 gigabit link between two switches using an existing fiber cable. What two characteristics must you check when ordering the transceivers?

> Use an appropriate Ethernet standard and wavelength for the type and grade of fiber and link distance (10GBASE-SR versus 10GBASE-LR, for instance) and match the connector type of the existing cable (LC or SC, for instance).

6. You have selected an SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx transceiver to implement a BiDi link between two switches. Should you provision a second SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx for the other switch?

> No, you need an SFP+ module with 1490 nm Tx and 1310 nm Rx.
