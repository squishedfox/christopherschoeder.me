# Transceivers

## Summary

Transceivers provide a way to translate signal between one type of media to another with a reduced amount of loss. There are some systems which come with hot-swappable capabilities but are much more costly.

## Small Form Factor Pluggable (SFP)

- Hardware which replaced the **Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC)** form factor.

## SFP/SFP+

Uses LC Form Factor connectors for Gigabit Ethernet. SFP+ is a 10 Gigabit Ethernet which also uses the LC form factor.

## QSFP/QSFP+

Quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP) is a transceiver for factor that supports 4 x 1 Gigabits per second links, aggregated to a single 4 Gigabit per second channel. QSFP+ (the enhanced version) supports 40 Gigabits per second.
