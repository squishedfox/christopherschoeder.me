# Wavelength Division Multiplexing

## Summary

A way of being able to transmit or receive one or more singals at a time

## BiDirectional Wavelength Division Multiplexing

Send and receive singals over different wavelengths so they do not collide over the networks. Typically Tx (Transmitting Signal) is sent 1310 nm and Rx (Receiver signal) is over 1490 nm. Each end must be installed with opposite paris.

## Coarse and Desne Wavelength Division Multiplexing

Higher capabilities for sending and receiving signals. Can support four to eight bidirectional channels over a single fiber strand. More costly as more expensive and presice lasers are required to send and receive signals.
