# Wiring Tools and Techniques

## Summary

Different environments require various understandings of what does and doesn't work for an environment. For example home network setups are different than corporate setups, or even small business setups which may exist in a shared office.

## Pulling Wire

Wires are fed from a large spool in a cardboard box from the cable management room or panel room to the workstation areas using different techniques that work appropriately for termination or for the physical movement of direction for the area. There are also bandwidth and equipment considerations to be made such as the number of terminals available in a single area, or hubs/switches that can be used.
