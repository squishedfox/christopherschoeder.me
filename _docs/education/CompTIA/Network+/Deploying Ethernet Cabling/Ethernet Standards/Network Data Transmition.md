# Network Data Transmition

## Summary

Cables carry data transmition over aplitutides/voltages and frequencies. The higher the frequency the more data that can be transmitted. Certain types of materials can carry frequencies farther than others, or have better security where the data transmission cannot be interrupted.

## Cabling

### Copper cabling

In general there are two types. Copper cabling is cheaper and easier to repair, and thus is more common in the market.

- Twisted Pair - typically meets the CAT standards adn carries better signal over longer distance.
- Coax Cable - loses signal quickly. Good or short distances.

### Fiber Optic

Uses inferred light waves to send signals down a cable. The connection cannot be interrupted or the light will break and no longer can be used to transmit any data or information.

Fiber Optic can transmit more data and has a better retention over longer distances but costs much more to maintain and place.
