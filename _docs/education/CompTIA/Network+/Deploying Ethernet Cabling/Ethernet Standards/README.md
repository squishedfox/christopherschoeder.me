# Ethernet Standards

## Summary

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) provides a standardized method of ensuring that the resources that are physically connecting nodes provide a way to create healthy bandwidth for applications.

## Ethernet Media Specifications

- The bit rate in megabits per second
- The signal mode (baseband or broadband).
- Designator for media type

### Example

10Base-T means that there is a 10 Megabits per second transmission rate with a baseband signal mode and (-T) tells the reader that it is twisted pair.
