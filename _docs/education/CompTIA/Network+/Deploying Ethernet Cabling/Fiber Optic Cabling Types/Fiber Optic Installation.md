# Fiber Optic Cable Installation

## Summary

There are different ways to connecto one or two nodes depending on the connectors and types of signals, and transfer modes used. Each has a way of working but the combinations must be worked out just right.

## Patch Cords

Optical Power meter can be used to determine whether an optical signal is being received from a particular fiber.

Patch Cords can be used at each of the connector in a mix of ways to ensure that the nodes work together and are sending signals.

## Finishing Type

- **Physical Contact (PC)** - The faces of the connector and fiber tip are polished so that they curve up slightly and fit together better, reducing return loss
- **UltraPhysical Contact (UPC)** - This means the cable and connector are polished to a higher standard than with a PC.
- **Angled Physical Contact (APC)** - The faces are angled for an even tighter connection and better return loss performance. APC cannot be mixed with PC or UPC. These connectors are usually deployed when the fiber is beng used to carry analag signaling.
