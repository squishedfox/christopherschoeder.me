# Review Activity: Fiber Optic Cabling Types

1. What type of fiber optic cable is suited for long distance links?

> Single mode fiber (SMF).

2. Which grade or grades of fiber have a 62.5 micron core?

> OM1

3. Which fiber Ethernet standard is best suited to implementing backbone cabling that does not exceed 200 m (656 feet) and can achieve at least 4 Gbps throughput?

> 10GBASE-SR

4. What maximum distance is defined in standards documentation for 1000BASE-LX running over MMF?

> 550 m (1804 feet). Note that 1000BASE-LX can run over MMF or SMF. SMF has much higher range.

5. You need to provision a fiber patch panel to terminate incoming cabling with green LC connectors. What type of ports should be provisioned on the patch panel?

> 550 m (1804 feet). Note that 1000BASE-LX can run over MMF or SMF. SMF has much higher range.
