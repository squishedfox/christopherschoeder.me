# Single Mode Fiber and Multimode Fiber

## Summary

Differenet modes of fiber based on needs for distance and environmental usages.

## Tyep(s)

- Single Mode Fiber (SMF8) - High frequencies with larges amounts of data over longer distances. Two different grades of OS1 for indoor and OS2 for outdoor.
- Multimode Fiber (MMF) - Smaller frequency with a shorter distance than **Single Mode Fiber**. More suitable for **Large Area Networks (LANs)** or **Wide Area Networks (WANs)**
