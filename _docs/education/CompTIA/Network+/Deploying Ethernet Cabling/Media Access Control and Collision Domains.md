# Network+ > Deploying Ethernet Cabling > Media Access Control and Collision Domains

## Summary

Nodes which shared the same connections also share the same constraints for bandwidth and communication. It's also possible that two nodes are attempting to communicate with a third node at the same time, or with each other.

## Collision Domain

A collision domain is when many nodes are all connected and can attempt to communicate or overwrite each other's packet requests. The more nodes on a network the more likely there is to be more collisions.

## CSMA/CD

Collision Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) creates a back off period where each node waits for a randomly selected period of time (in microseconds) to retransmit a message in hopes of increasing bandwidth and reducing more collisions with other signals.
