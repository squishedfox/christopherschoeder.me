## Question

1. With CSMA/CD, what will happen if a host has data to transmit and there is already data on the cable?

    > The host will wait for a random backoff period before attempting to transmit again.

2. Which Ethernet standard works at 100 Mbps over Cat 5 or better copper cable?

    > 100BASE-TX.

3. Which copper Ethernet standard meets the bandwidth requirements for clients in an office network while minimizing costs?

    > Gigabit Ethernet. Provisioning 10 GbE would require upgrading the network adapters in most client devices, as well as potentially requiring upgraded cable installation.

4. A network designer wants to run a 10 gigabit backbone between two switches in buildings that are 75 m (246 feet) apart. What is the main consideration when selecting an appropriate copper cable?

    > At that distance, some type of shielded or screened cat 6A or better cable is required for the installation to be compliant with Ethernet standard 10GBASE-T.
