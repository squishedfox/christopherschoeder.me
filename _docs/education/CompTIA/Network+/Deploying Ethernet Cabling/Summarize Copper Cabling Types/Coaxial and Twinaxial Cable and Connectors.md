# Coaxial and Twinaxial Cable and Connectors

## Summary

Coaxial cable is a solid copper cable carrying signal between two nodes on a network.

## Coaxial Cable

### Makup

Coaxial cable usually has a plastic cover around the solid material, followed by a mesh metal, and then a rubber outer material that protects all the other components.

In Coax Cable typically the physical copper component which carries the signal has an AWG (American Width Gauge) of 18.

### Signals

Used for

- Cable Model and Internet Protocol systems
- Used for Cable Access Television (CATV)

### Terminations

typically coax cables and connections are made using a F-Type connector which requires securing the cable into a wall by screwing it into place

## Twinaxial

### Makeup

- Contains two inner connectors.
- Used in data centers
