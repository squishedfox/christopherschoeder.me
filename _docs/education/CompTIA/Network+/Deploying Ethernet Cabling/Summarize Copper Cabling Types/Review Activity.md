# Review Activity: Copper Cabling Types

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/925975953/ethernet-standards-flash-cards/)

1. What is the measurement standard for wire thickness?

   > Which cable type consists of a single core made of solid copper surrounded by insulation, a braided metal shielding, and an outer cover

2. What are the characteristics of S/FTP cable?

   > This is a twisted pair type of copper cable using a braided outer screen and foil shielding for each pair to reduce interference.

3. Which categories of U/UTP cable are certified to carry data transmission faster than 100 Mbps?

   > Cat 5e and Cat 6/6A. Cat 7 and Cat 8 are screened/shielded types. 

4. True or False? Cat standards apply only to wiring. 

   > Falseâ€”Connectors and interconnects are also rated to cat standards. 

5. 100BASE-T transmit pins are 1 and 2. What color code are the wires terminated to these pins under T568A and T568B? 

   > Green/White (pin 1) and Green (pin 2) for T658A or Orange (pin 1)/White and Orange (pin 2) for T568B. 

6. Why is plenum-rated cable used when cable is run in an area where building air is circulated? 

   > Plenum-rated cable produces minimal amounts of smoke if burned, must be self-extinguishing, and must meet other strict fire safety standards. 

7. Which cable type consists of a single core made of solid copper surrounded by insulation, a braided metal shielding, and an outer cover

   > Coax.
