# Shielded and Screened Twisted Pair Cable Considerations

## Summary

Shielded cable-also known as shielded twisted pair (STP)-typically can have less issues with cross talk than non-sheielded twisted pair.

## Types of shielding

:caution do not intermix types of shielding with cables between nodes

- Screen cable - is a copper wires that is thinly shielded around all pairs. 
- Fully shielded - foil pairs have an outer screan around all pairs and then an inner foil-shield around all other pairs
