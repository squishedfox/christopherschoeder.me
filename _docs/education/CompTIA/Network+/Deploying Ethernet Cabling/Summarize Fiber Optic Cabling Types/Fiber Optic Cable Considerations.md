# Fiber Optic Considerations

## Summary

Provides better transmittion rate over longer distances than copper cabling and has a higher resiliency against interception.

## Makeup

- Uses pulses of infrared light
- Uses light reflections to keep the light bouncing back into the core of the fiber optic cable and maintain the strength of the signal
- Buffer is a protective plastic coating. It may be of a tight or loose configuration, with the loose format using some form of lubricant between the strand and the sheath.
