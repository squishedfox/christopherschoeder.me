# Ethernet Switch Types

## Summary

There is no actual limitation to vendor supply for Ethernet Switches, nor the number of ports a switch can have. They are however, commonly dominated in the market by Cisco and Nexus. 

## Categories

- **Unmanaged versus managed** - Managed versus unmanaged switches differ in how they can be, or that they _can_ be configured. Small Home, Small Office (SOHO) switches likely are unmanaged and simply just work on the network. Enterprise/Corporate Switches likely are managed and often need configuration. 
- **Stackable** - Stacked units which can be combined to communicate together and function as a single unit.
- **Moduler versus fixed** - Fixed switches cannot be upgraded, or modified. Moduler switches can have additional ports or configurations added tothem.
- **Desktop versus rack-mounted** - Desktop switches commonly are 8 - 16 ports, while enterprise switches can be up to 100 ports and often should be stored in a network rack.
