# Auto MDI/MDI-X

## Summary

MDI switches, no idea what a good summary is here :shrug

## MDI

Traditional MDI (Media dependant Interface) Switches send signals on pin 1 nd 2 and receive signals on 3 and 6.

### MDI-X

MDI-X (Media Dependant Interface) Switches send signals on pin(s) 3 and 6, and receive signals on 3 and 6.

## Auto MDI

Auto MDI detects the configuration on the network to ensure that sending and receiving signals happen on the correct pins.
