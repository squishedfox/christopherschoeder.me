# Switch Interface Configuration

## Summary

Ethernet switches often provide an Application Programming Interface (API) to configure through a Command Line Tool/Utility. 

## Common Configuration Modes

- **User EXEC Mode** - read only mode commands that can be used to display the current configurations of a switch.
- **Privileged EXEC mode/eneable mode** - provides elevated execution and run priviledges for shutting down, updating, configurations on a switch.
- **Global configuration mode** - Allows users to write configuration updates.

## Common Commands

- `show config` often will display the existing adapters and configurations on a switch
- `show interface` lists the state of all interfaces or specified interface
