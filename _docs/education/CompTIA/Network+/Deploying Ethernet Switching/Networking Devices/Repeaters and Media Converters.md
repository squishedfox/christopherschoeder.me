# Repeaters and Media Converters

## Summary

Repeaters and media converters are a way of continuing signal reliability and strength to greater distances than originally capable on their own through a single cable.

## Repeaters

Repeaters appear transparent to the network because they do not perform any action to the network other thant to continue to run a singal for a longer distance. It is a way of "boosting" the signal strength to increase distance.

## Media Converters

Media Converters provide a way of changing between one medium of signal type to another. For example they may transfer a signal from standard electromagnetic wavelength over a Copper cable to light waves in a fiber optic cable.

- Single mode fiber to twisted pair - Convert powered singals from electrical signal over copper to light over fiber.
- Multimode fiber to twisted pair - a different media converter model is required to convert the light signals carried over MMF media.
