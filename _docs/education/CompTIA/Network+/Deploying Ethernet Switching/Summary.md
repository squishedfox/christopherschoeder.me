# Summary

You should be able to identify the features of network devices operating at layers 1 and 2 and determine their appropriate placement on the network. You should be able to deploy and configure Ethernet switches with appropriate port configurations.

## Guidelines for Deploying Network Devices

Follow these guidelines to deploy switches and other networking devices:

- Identify a switch model that will meet current and future needs, taking into account port density, management features, and any requirement to use Power over Ethernet.
- Configure appropriate port settings for high-bandwidth hosts, such as link aggregation, jumbo frames, and flow control.
- Identify any hosts that require nonstandard configuration, such as disabling auto-negotiation of speed and duplex settings or disabling auto MDI/MDI-X.
- Create a management plan for legacy hub and bridge appliances to ensure they do not impact overall network performance.
- Identify any need for physical layer repeater or media converter functions that cannot be met by installing a switch.
- Make a plan for capturing network traffic at strategic points in the network, either through port mirroring or via a network TAP.
- Optionally, use known or locally administered MAC addresses and port security to mitigate the risk of unknown devices connecting to the network.
