## Summary

You should be able to use an appropriate IPv4 addressing scheme to plan a subnetted network.

Guidelines for Planning IPv4 Addressing Schemes

Follow these guidelines to configure subnets and use appropriate IP addressing schemes:

- Ensure good understanding of IPv4 addressing concepts to facilitate network design and support:
    - The use of 32-bit IPv4 addresses and netmasks or network prefixes to identify networks and subnets within networks.
    - The role of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in mapping layer 3 to layer 2 IP:MAC addresses 
    - The importance and uses of unicast, broadcast, multicast, and anycast addressing schemes.
    - The impact of legacy classful addressing features on address selection and usage, especially as regards private versus public ranges and loopback, class D, and class E ranges.
- Work out the topology of switches, virtual LANs (VLANs), and routers to create broadcast domain network segments that meet requirements for performance, security, and physical/data link network technologies.
- Allocate more bits to the netmask to create more subnets with fewer hosts per subnet, or fewer bits to the netmask to create fewer subnets with more hosts per subnet.
- Ensure that each host is configured with an appropriate IP address/subnet mask and default gateway for its subnet.
