# Explaining Network Topologies and Types

## Objectives

1.2 Explain the characteristics of network topologies and network types.

## Client-Server versus Peer-to-Peer Networks


Client-server systems are where one system is always the provider of resources and the other is always the consumer. In a peer-to-peer system hosts take turns being the server and the client and resources are sent back and forth in a decentralized way.

### Termes

- Client is a system/host which consumes resources
- Server is a system/host which provides resources

## Network Types

Network types are primarily made up of size and scope.

## Network Topology

Network Topology is the structure of physical and logical networks

## Star Topology

Start topologiy is where many nodes are connected to one single sentral node such as a hub, switch or router and run segments from there to hosts. Sometimes this topology is also called a hub-and-spoke.

## Mesh Toplogy

Mesh toplogy is used for Wide Area Networks (WANs) and public networks such as the internet.

A mesh network has the forumal n(n - 1)/2 where _n_ is the number of nodes in a network. For example, where n=6 there are 30 links required, for 40 nodes there are 40 * (40 - 1) / 2 = 780 links required.

The biggest benefit of a mesh topology is redudancy.

## Ring Topology

Ring toplogy is where there is a ring of nodes which are all segmented together in a linked system forming a ring. The benefit of this topology is that if one link is removed for whatever reason the traffic can go the long way around the ring and still reach it's destination host.

## Bus Topology

A bus topology is a one way linked system where all messages are sent down a single segment. A pro is that it is cheap and easy to install, but a con is that it can be slow and have very little throughput.

## Hybrid Topology

A hybrid topology is one that mixes two or more diferent types of toplogies to create a fault tolerant and fast network.

## Review Activity

1. What network infrastructure implementation links multiple buildings within the same city? 

> Metropolitan area network (MAN). 

2. What term is used to describe a topology in which two nodes share a single link?

> Point-to-point.

3. You need operations to continue if one link fails. How many links does it take to connect three sites?

> The number of links is n(n-1)/2, so with three sites, the sum is 3*2/2, which works out to three.

4. What types of devices are connected in a PAN?

> A personal area network (PAN) links devices such as laptops and smartphones and provides connectivity with peripheral devices (printers, input devices, headsets, and so on) plus wearable technology, such as fitness trackers and smart watches.
