# Layer 4 - Transport Layer

## Summary

Layer 4 is known as the host-to-host or the end-to-end layer. The Transport Layer helps identify the ports that need to be used to communicate in each application in data attached to the packet called segments.

## How it works

The transport layer appends a port number to the source and destination network addresses in the form of segments. Other layers will ignore this portion and see it as just part of the payload.

## Redlivery

Redlivery can be requested from source hosts when a package is corrupted and does not have the correct information or may not have received a package it expected.

## Firewalls

Firewalls can be implemented at this layer where packets may only be sent or received from certain sources on port(s). 

## Devices

- Switches
- Load Balancers
- Security Appliances like Advanced Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
