# SOHO - Internet

## Summary

Most Small Home, Small Office (SOHO)s are setup with a Modem connected to a Internet Service Provider (ISP) to another Wide Area Network (WAN). At times the customer router or gateway may be the same device as the modem rented from the ISP or possibly owned and configured directly by the customer.

## Internet Service Providers (ISP)

Internet Service Providers create larger networks between each other to send communications between each other in different regions.
