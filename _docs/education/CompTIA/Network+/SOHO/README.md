## Summary

You should be able to compare and contrast OSI model layers and encapsulation concepts and apply them to analyzing the function of networks and networking components.

Guidelines for Comparing OSI Model Network Functions

Follow these guidelines to make effective use of the OSI model:

    Use characteristics of physical layer media and devices to plan wiring topologies and identify potential performance issues.
    Use the data link layer to plan logical segments to isolate groups of hosts for performance or security reasons.
    At the network layer, map data link segments to logical network IDs and work out rules for how hosts in one network should be permitted or denied access to other networks.
    Evaluate service requirements at the transport layer to determine which ports a host should expose.
    Use the session, presentation, and application layers to determine performance and security requirements for the services that the network is providing.
