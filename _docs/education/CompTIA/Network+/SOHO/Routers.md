## SOHO - Routers

## Summary

Small Home, Small Offices typically run on a single point of entry to the World Wide Web (WWW) Network called a Router. 

## Physical Layer Functions

- RJ-45 connectors
- Wireless Antennas to transmit and receive signals
- (Sometimes) a modem to be able to connect and transform messages coming from ISPs (Internet Service Providers)

## Data Link Layer Functions

**Ethernet Switch** - The RJ-45 jacks are connected via an ethernet switch
**Wireless Access Point (WAP)** - Provides wireless capabilities to connect radio based devices 

The router can act as a switch in a way that it can understand packets and direct them to where they need to go on the local network based on the address.

## Network Layer Functions

At the Network Layer the router can chose between sending packets outward towards a WAN (Wide Area Network) or the Lan (Local Area network) based on the address.

The Router runes a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) which assigns IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to each connected device. Typically local device addresses are in the form of 10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x.

The WAN (Wide Area Network) Capabilities provides a public IP (Internet Protocol) address to the router and all devices behind it and performs the forwarding jobs between the WAN (Wide Area Network) and the LAN (Local Area Network).
