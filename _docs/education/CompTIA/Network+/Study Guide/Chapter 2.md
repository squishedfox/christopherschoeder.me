- Open Systems Intercommunication (OSI) Standard was created by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

### Layer 1 Physical Layer

- Examples: Physical Topology

Summary: Moves bits between devices and specifies voltage, wire speed, and pin-out of cables

- Examples: Framing

Summary: Combines packets into bytes and bytes into frames, access to media using MAC addresses, and performs error detection, not correction

### Layer 3 Network Layer

- Examples: Routing

Summary: Provides logical adressing, which routers use for path determination

### Layer 4 Transport Layer

- Examples: End-to-end connection

Summary: Provides reliable or unreliable delivery and performs error correction before retransmition

### Layer 5 Session Layer

- Examples: Dialog Control

Summary: Keeps different appplications' data separate

### Layer 6 Presenation Layer

- Examples: Data encryption, compresion, and translation servies

Summary: Presents the data and handels processing such as encryption

### Layer 7 Application Layer
