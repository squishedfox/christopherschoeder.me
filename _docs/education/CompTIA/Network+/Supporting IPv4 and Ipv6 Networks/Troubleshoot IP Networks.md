# Troubleshoot IP Networks

## Objectives

5.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot general networking issues

## Hardware Failure and Network Interface Issues

While layer 3 of the OSI model (network layer) typically is the culperate of many issues it's good to look at some other common hardware or equipment problems.

### Power Issues

Power issues are best remediated through using basic home systems like UPSs (Uninterruptible power supplies) or backup generators which are more common in enterprise systems.

### Hardware Failure Issues

Switches or cables may be the source of the problem and can be checked using a loopback tool, checking device drivers on host machines, verifying the correct network adapters are bieng used on each end of the segment. 

### Interface Status Issues

Interface problems may be at the host, and can be easily verified by looking at the LED status indicator.
