# Network Troubleshooting Methodology

## Summary

Use the CompTIA Network+ Troubleshooting Methodology to figure out why the issue happened, and resolve it so that it does not occur again. Just fixing the problem isn't always enough, but you need to understand why it happened.

## Steps to Resolve

1. Identify the problem
2. Establish a theory of probable cause
3. Test the theory to determine cause
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
5. Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
6. Verify full system functionality, and if applicable, implement preventive measures
7. Document findings, actions, and outcomes
