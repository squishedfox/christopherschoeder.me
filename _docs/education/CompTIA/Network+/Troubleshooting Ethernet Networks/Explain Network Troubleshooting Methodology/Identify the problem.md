# Identify the Problem

## Summary

Identify the area of effect and work backwards. For example, identify if it's a floor of people, specific device types, geographical area, etc.

## Gathering Information

- Ask the user when they started experiencing the issue
- Ask if they have changed anything recently that may be causing the issue, or doing anything differently than they normally do. Any new software updates, or changes to their system.
- Ask the user if anyone else on their team is effected by the issue
- Triage the problem and understand the urgency
- Work through understanding if the issue is a single problem or multiple problems
- discover if the issue is a hardware issue or a software issue

### Question Users

- Ask questions to users about their system, what their experiencing, offer basic techniques to see cause and effect on their system and see if there are positive or negative concequences.
- Ask "yes/no" question to reduce churn of conversation

## Create a working theory

- Test out a possible solution to "move the bar" and see if the issue improves, or gets worse. e.g. did they gain or lose access to parts of what they are working on.

### Reproducing the Issue

- Being able to reproduce the issue gives a more scientific method to solving the problem for now and in the future.

## Provide Updates and Evidence

- Document the issue and generate any tickets necessary documenting steps to resolve or timeframes
- Document resolution and the necessary resources to complete the ticket

## Validate fix

- After plan of action has been implemented then identify with the end users or all effected end users that they are no longer experiencing the problem
