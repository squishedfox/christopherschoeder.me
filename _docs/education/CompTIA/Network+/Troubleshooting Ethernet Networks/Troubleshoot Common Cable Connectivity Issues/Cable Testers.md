# Cable Testers

## Summary

Cable connectivity issues can occur in different ways causing limited speed and throughput or issues with a possible cross over system that is not expecting it.

## Validate Cable Types

- Ensure the cable you are using has the capabilities of supporting expected speed
- Ensure the cable you are using has the correct shielding and meets the required standards for the environment
- Ensure the cable you are using has a solid connection to the terminals or nodes on either end.
