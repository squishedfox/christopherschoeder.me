# Cross Talk Issues

## Summary

Cross talk is measured in dB (decibals) as a way of measuring if there is lost connectivity in a cable

## Measuring Crosstalk

- Near end (NEXT) - usually caused by excessive untwisting of pairs or faulty bonding of shield elements.
- Attenuation to crosstalk Ratio, Near end (ACRN) - Measuring using a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) means that a high measurement indicates that the cable is healthy and that there is little noise, a lower value such as 0 indicates that there is a possability of cross talk happening.
- Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio, far end (ACRF) - This is measured on the receiving end of a cable network system rather than the sending end. This tells what the results are on the other side of your test.
