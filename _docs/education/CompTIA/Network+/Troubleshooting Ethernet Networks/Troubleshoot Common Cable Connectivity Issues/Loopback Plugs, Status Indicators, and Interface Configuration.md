# Loopback Plugs, Status Indicators, and Interface Configuration

## Summary

Loopback adapters are a easy and good first step to find if a network adapter or switch is facing any issues with communicating via ports or has a miss configuration setup in play.

## Indicator Lights

- Solid Green - Solid green on a network adapter or switch indicates that the port is functioning as expected but there is no traffic on that port.
- Flash Green - Flashing green indicates that the network adapter or switch is working as expected and that there is active traffic on that port.
- No light - There is no traffic or the port is disabled
- Blinking amber - a fault has been detected (duplex mismatch, excessive collisions, or redundancy check errors, for instance)
- Solid amber - the port is blocked by teh spanning tree algorithm, which works to preventloops within a switched network.
