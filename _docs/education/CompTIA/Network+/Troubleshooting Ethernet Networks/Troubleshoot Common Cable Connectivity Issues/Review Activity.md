# Review Activity

1. What cabling faults would a wire map tester detect?

> Opens, shorts, and transpositions (reversed and crossed pairs). 

2. How would you test for excessive attenuation in a network link? 

> Measure the insertion loss in dB by using a cable tester. 

3. What is the reason for making power sum crosstalk measurements when testing a link? 

> Power sum crosstalk measures cable performance when all four pairs are used, as Gigabit and 10G Ethernet do.

4. Your network uses UTP cable throughout the building. There are a few users who complain of intermittent network connectivity problems. You cannot determine a pattern for these problems that relates to network usage. You visit the users' workstations and find that they are all located close to an elevator shaft. What is a likely cause of the intermittent connectivity problems? How might you correct the problem? 

> If the cabling is being run too close to the elevator equipment, when the elevator motor activates, it produces interference on the network wire. You can replace the UTP cable with screened/shielded copper wire or reposition the cables away from the elevator shaft.

5. You have connected a computer to a network port and cannot get a link. You have tested the adapter and cable and can confirm that there are no problems. No other users are experiencing problems. The old computer also experienced no problems. What cause would you suspect, and what is a possible next step? 

> Speed mismatchâ€”Check the autonegotiate settings on the adapter and port.
